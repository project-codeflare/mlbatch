# Cluster Checker

The tool in this directory produces a summary view on GPU quotas and utilization
on the cluster. It also diagnoses the state of a cluster looking for common
issues.

The tool is implemented in JavaScript and intended to run with Node.js.

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with the npm package manager.

Install dependencies with:
```sh
npm install
```

Run the tool against the current Kubernetes context with:
```sh
node checker.js
```
```

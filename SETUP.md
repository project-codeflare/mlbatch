# MLBatch Setup

The MLBatch setup consists of a *cluster setup* to be done once
and a *team setup* to be repeated for each team that will
be using the cluster.

Batch users should only be permitted to create AppWrappers or other
workload Kinds that are natively supported by Kueue. The cluster setup
defines a `mlbatch-edit` role which enforces these restrictions and
will be used in the setup process for each team of MLBatch users that
is onboarded.

This setup has been developed on OpenShift 4.14 and Kubernetes 1.27 and
is intended to support OpenShift 4.12 and up and/or Kubernetes 1.25 and up.

To start with, recursively clone and enter this repository:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/project-codeflare/mlbatch.git
cd mlbatch
```

Detailed instructions and configuration files can be found in subfolders,
one for each base platform.

Things to remember/do when updating RHOAI versions.

1. Clone setup directory from previous RHOAI release.
2. Inspect all files we are overlaying in mlbatch-subscription's
   overlay of ODH and merge any upstream changes.
3. Replicate all subscription deltas in upgrade files and note in
   UPGRADE steps.
4. Be sure to verify ready status of RHOAI operator, DSC and DSCI
   in console to make sure the overlays were successfully applied.
